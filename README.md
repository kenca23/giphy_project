# Technical Exercise

Thank you for taking the time to work on this technical exercise.

This exercise is meant to test your ability to build a single page application:

- Access a public API and fetch data from it
- Display that data on the page
- Update the UI of the page without refreshing
- Build a polished user experience you’d be proud to ship

This exercise is broken down into two categories, product requirements and engineering requirements.

## Product Requirements

Perform a search against any public photo API and display the results on a page.

You can use any API that you want, but we’ve created a token for you to search against the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/)(`LiT4XaeBUDCDtVpLNuTcc8fzKv84AmW6`). You can lookup their documentation on how to access their search endpoint.

We expect:

1. A single page with a search input and a list (or grid) of photo thumbnails
1. The initial page load should contain an "empty state" in place of the photo thumbnails
1. After the user enters a search query the results should be displayed on the page
1. The thumbnail should be clickable and link to the full resolution version

If you have extra time we would like to see the photo thumbnail open a lightbox when you click it (instead of linking to the full resolution version).

## Engineering Requirements

- The single page app should be built via React.js
- You’re free to use any http client library
- You’re free to use any state management library
- You’re free to use any CSS library
- You don't need to focus on cross browser concerns, it only needs to work in one major browser (Chrome, FireFox, Safari, Edge)
- **Please commit your code as you progress through the challenge**
  - As part of your submission please include the SCM folder (.git) so we can review your commit history

## Getting started

We have provided this repo as a starting point so you can focus on code without having to worry about getting your project setup.

We only ask that you’re on the latest LTS version of node.js (this is reflected in the `.nvmrc` file). Then you can run:

```sh
$ nvm use # or your own way to use to the latest LTS version of node
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

## Seeking help

This project was initialized using create-react-app, please see their documentation for any technical issues you might run into.

If anything else is unclear or just have other technical questions, please email eric.wolfe@kareo.com

## Submitting your code

1. Remove the `node_modules` directory
1. Zip this directory
1. Upload it to the provided link (attached in our email to you)
